🚀 AI-Powered Fake LinkedIn Profile Detector
🔍 Overview
With the rise of AI-generated faces and ChatGPT-written bios, fake LinkedIn profiles are becoming a serious issue. This project detects fake profiles by analyzing:
✅ Profile Pictures – Checks if an image is AI-generated or real using DeepFace
✅ Profile Bios – Uses GPT-4 to determine if the profile description was written by a human or AI

🛠 How It Works
1️⃣ Fake Profile Picture Detection
DeepFace extracts age, gender, and race from a LinkedIn profile picture
If the image shows inconsistencies (e.g., unnatural features, AI-like distortions), it may be fake
2️⃣ AI-Generated Bio Detection
GPT-4 analyzes the profile bio text
It detects AI-generated descriptions commonly used in fake profiles
🚀 How to Run the Project
Step 1: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install deepface opencv-python matplotlib numpy openai
Step 2: Set Up OpenAI API Key
Open main.py
Replace "your-api-key-here" with your OpenAI API Key
Step 3: Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Upload a LinkedIn profile picture (e.g., sample_profile.jpg)
Enter a LinkedIn profile bio
The program analyzes the image & bio and prints whether they seem fake
📌 Future Enhancements
🚀 Automated Profile Scraping – Collect LinkedIn profile data automatically
🚀 Deepfake Detection – Use GAN-based deepfake models for advanced analysis
🚀 Web App (Flask/Streamlit) – Make it an interactive tool for recruiters
